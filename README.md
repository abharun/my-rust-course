# Road to Rustacean

Hello, developers!

A month ago, I got a chance to meet Rust languageðŸ¦€, and I got crazy about it!

So I decided to become a Rustacean.

As a step to learn Rust language, I'm trying to track some code snaps for particular functionalities and crates. Hope you Love it~!ðŸ’–

## Simple multi-threading
If you input number of threads and max range, then each thread will output from 1 to `range` that is randomly generated.

Input: `<number_of_factories>` `<max value of range>`

Output:
```shell
... ...
Factory #10:20
Factory #10:21
Factory #6:37
Factory #6:38
Factory #6:39
Factory #8:37
Factory #8:38
Factory #8:39
... ...
