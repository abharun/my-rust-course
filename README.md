# Road to Rustacean

Hello, developers!

A month ago, I got a chance to meet Rust languageðŸ¦€, and I got crazy about it!

So I decided to become a Rustacean.

As a step to learn Rust language, I'm trying to track some code snaps for particular functionalities and crates. Hope you Love it~!ðŸ’–

# Implementations

<a id = "simplemultithreading"></a>

## Simple multi-threading
If you input number of threads and max range, then each thread will output from 1 to `range` that is randomly generated.

`Input`: Number of factories and max ranges per factory

`Output`:
```shell
... ...
Factory #10:20
Factory #10:21
Factory #6:37
Factory #6:38
Factory #6:39
Factory #8:37
Factory #8:38
Factory #8:39
... ...
```

<a id = "echowithchannel"></a>

## Echo user input via channel
If you input any string, then the funcion would echo the input via channel. You can terminate by inputing `bye`.

`Input`: Any string you want.

`Output`:
```shell
... ...
my input
Your Input: my input
again input
Your Input: again input
... ...
```

If you do not input any string within 10 seconds, it would be automatically terminated.

<a id = "taskmanagewithyield"></a>

## Task management with `tokio::task::yield_now()`
You can Implement multi-threading tasks with `yield_now()` by using it with conjunction with `tokio::try_join!()`.  Here shows how it works.

`Input`: Counting limits for two tasks.

`Output`:
```shell
Task 1 timestamp is #0
Task 2 timestamp is #0
Task 2 timestamp is #1
Task 1 timestamp is #1
Task 1 timestamp is #2
Task 2 timestamp is #2
Task 2 timestamp is #3
Task 1 timestamp is #3
... ...
```

You can see that two tasks are working simultaneously.
